# Contributing

## Thanks for considering contributing to this project.

For any changes to the API or added features, please create an issue prior to submitting a pull request.  Prior to release of a stable build, there are a ton of things to get working on. 

Issues will be the primary method of communication, and a separate todo list or project will not be created.

More than anything, have fun!
